# Astrelik Research Lab

English · [Русский](README.ru.md)

A non-commercial research lab studying language-model training, data, memory, evaluation, and computational resources through reproducible comparisons with clearly stated limits.

## Research

| Study | Area | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [AR-1 — Training-data sampling: files or windows](studies/training/AR-1-data-sampling/README.md) | Training and data | Completed, scoped comparison across three seeds |
| [AR-2 — Fact-order augmentation](studies/memory/AR-2-fact-order/README.md) | Memory and robustness | Completed scoped comparison |
| [AR-3 — kNN memory: accuracy and changed facts](studies/memory/AR-3-knn-memory/README.md) | Memory and evaluation | Completed ordinary and paired comparison across three seeds |
| [AR-4 — Local regression protection](studies/training/AR-4-local-regression/README.md) | Training and retention | Completed local-step study with CPU reproduction |
| [AR-5 — Identifier diversity and argument binding](studies/training/AR-5-variable-binding/README.md) | Training and code generalization | Completed matched fine-tuning comparison; primary and post-hoc results separated |
| [AR-6 — Stale kNN memory and probability gates](studies/memory/AR-6-knn-stale-memory/README.md) | Memory and evaluation | Completed controlled comparison across three seeds; saved-trace analysis |

Study reports are currently written in Russian. Each report presents its question, method, results, limitations, and available reproduction materials. Negative results are retained; releasing an improved model is not a requirement for a useful study.

## AI assistance

AI assists with code, checks, analysis, and writing. Measurements come from actual runs; AI assistance does not itself establish correctness. Each study describes its checks and limitations.
